# TuentiContest9
Exercises 1 to 6 from the 9th edition of Tuenti Contest

The exercices are made with Python because I wanted to practice this language.
I don't code since at least two years ago (2017) and didn't touched Python since 2015, so this exercices aren't perfect.

I will write here any questions I receive.
